# DevSquad's Last Project at </Salt> Sweep 

Sweep is a app that visualizes data from SCB. The time allowed to create this app was two weeks so it's not that clean, but it works. Multiple categories could've been added but we ran out of time.

## To view/run the project

1. Start a terminal in the **server** folder
2. Run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
npm install
```
3. 
```bash
npm run server
```
4. Leave that server running and open another terminal in the **swestat** folder.
5. Run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
npm install
```
6. 
```bash
npm run server
```
7. Done!
